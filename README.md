# ATHEROSCLEROSIS-MODEL-IN-THREE-DIMENSIONS
These codes investigate the effect of growth in single directions as well as anisotropic and isotropic case on opening angle as a measurment of the residual strain. The domain is a nonsymmetric 3D domain. All the Mesh files have the same geometry but possibly different meshing (to get better convergence in different cases of growth).
